                                 <h4>Personal data of minors</h4>
                                 <p>In compliance with the provisions of articles 8 of the GDPR and 7 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Personal Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights, only individuals over the age of 14 may give their consent for the lawful processing of their personal data by <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span>. If a minor under 14 years of age wishes to give their personal data, parental or guardian consent will be required for the processing of their data.</p>
                                 
                                 <h4>Secrecy and security of personal data</h4>

                                 <p>The Website has an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, which ensures that personal data is transmitted securely and confidentially, as data is transmitted between the server and the User, and in feedback, fully encrypted or encrypted.</p>
                                 <p>However, because <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> cannot guarantee the absolute impregnability of the internet or the total absence of hackers or others fraudulently accessing personal data, the Data Controller undertakes to notify the User without undue delay when a personal data breach occurs that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Following the provisions of Article 4 of the GDPR, a personal data breach is understood as a security breach that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.</p>
                                 <p>Personal data will be treated confidentially by the Data Controller, who undertakes to inform and ensure by a legal or contractual obligation that such confidentiality is respected by its employees, associates, and any person to whom the information is made accessible.</p>
                                 
                                 <h4>Rights derived from the processing of personal data</h4>
                                 <p>The User has over <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> and may, therefore, exercise the following rights recognized in the GDPR and the Organic Law on Data Protection:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                     <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> The User has the right to obtain confirmation of whether or not <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> is processing their personal data and, if so, to obtain information about their specific personal data and the processing <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> has carried out or is carrying out, as well as, among other things, information available on the origin of such data and the recipients of the communications made or planned for such data.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> The User has the right to have their personal data modified if it is inaccurate or incomplete, according to the purposes of the processing.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”):</strong> The User has the right, provided that current legislation does not establish otherwise, to obtain the erasure of their personal data when such data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or processed; the User has withdrawn their consent to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the processing; the User objects to the processing and there is no other legitimate reason to continue with it; the personal data has been unlawfully processed; or the personal data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong> The User has the right to restrict the processing of their personal data. The User has the right to obtain the restriction of processing when the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the User, for a period that allows the Data Controller to verify the accuracy of such data; the processing is unlawful, and the User opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of its use; the Data Controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the User needs it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; and the User has objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Data Controller override those of the User.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> In cases where the processing is carried out by automated means, the User has the right to receive from the Data Controller their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit it to another controller. Where technically feasible, the Data Controller will directly transmit the data to that other controller.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> The User has the right to object to the processing of their personal data. <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> will no longer process personal data unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
                                     <li><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making:</strong> The User has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects concerning the User or significantly affects them in a similar way, unless it is necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between the User and <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span>, is permitted by Union or Member State law to which <span class="blanc-space ng-binding">Tenmar Agency</span> is subject, or is based on the User's explicit consent.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p>The User may exercise their rights through written communication addressed to the Data Controller with the subject "GDPR-[RIGHT NAME]," specifying:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                     <li>User's full name and a copy of their ID.</li>

                                 <p>If the User believes that there is a problem or violation of current regulations in the way their personal data is being processed, they have the right to effective judicial protection and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the state where they have their habitual residence, place of work, or where the alleged violation took place. In Spain, the supervisory authority is the Spanish Data Protection Agency (<a href="https://www.aepd.es" target="_blank">https://www.aepd.es</a>).</p>
